I am a Health Scientist with a masters in Public Heath and Infectious Diseases ([VU](https://masters.vu.nl/en/programmes/health-sciences/index.aspx)), a postgraduate certificate in International Public Health ([LSTM](https://www.lstmed.ac.uk/study/courses/international-public-health)), and a PhD in Global Health ([AIGHD](https://www.aighd.org/)-[UvA](https://www.uva.nl/en)). I am a registered Epidemiologist ('Epidemioloog B' [VVE](https://epidemiologie.nl/registration/registration-epidemiologist-a-or-b.html) & [SMBWO](https://smbwo.nl/erkenningen-per-richting/?rubriek=Epidemiologie)).

My experience ranges from designing and conducting research projects, to project and data management, to the subsequent communication of findings to different stakeholders (clinical, public health, policy, general public). 
I have extensive experience working with HIV cohort studies in sub-Sahara Africa ([PASER]  (https://www.aighd.org/project/paser/), [MARCH](https://www.aighd.org/project/march/)), and in the Netherlands ([ATHENA](https://www.hiv-monitoring.nl/en/who-we-are/athena-cohort)). I collaborate with academic and public institutions as a researcher, lecturer, and  student supervisor (BSc, MSc and PhD level).

Since September 2018, I am a fellow of the [European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training (EPIET) by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)]((https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/epiet-euphem)), based at the [Robert Koch-Institut](https://www.rki.de/EN/Content/Institute/DepartmentsUnits/InfDiseaseEpidem/Epidemiology_Training_Programme.html) in Berlin, Germany.
