The interplay between health and society fascinates me, which brought me to health sciences and international public health. Analysing large observational datasets makes my heart beat faster, as well as studying the epidemiological techniques and research methodology itself. Never without questioning the social context and clinical relevance of these studies. 

A large part of my research experience focussed on HIV cohort studies in sub-Saharan Africa and the Netherlands. Subsequently, I have broadened my scope to other (viral) infectious diseases and outbreak investigation, including hepatitis C, HPV, measles, and SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. 

Furthermore, I enjoy science communication, teaching and student supervision.
