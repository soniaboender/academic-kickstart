The interplay between health and society fascinates me, which brought me to health sciences and international public health. A large part of my work and research experience focussed on HIV cohort studies in sub-Sahara Africa and the Netherlands. Subsequently, I have broadened my scope to other (viral) infectious diseases and outbreaks, including hepatitis C, HPV, measles, and SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. Furthermore, I enjoy science communication, teaching and student supervision.
