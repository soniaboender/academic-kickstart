I am a Health Scientist with a masters in Public Heath and Infectious Diseases, a postgraduate certificate in International Public Health, and a PhD in Global Health. I am a registered Epidemiologist ('Epidemioloog B', [VVE](https://epidemiologie.nl/registration/registration-epidemiologist-a-or-b.html)/[SMBWO](https://smbwo.nl/erkenningen-per-richting/?rubriek=Epidemiologie)).

My experience ranges from designing and conducting research projects, to project and data management, to the subsequent communication of findings to different stakeholders: clinical, public health, policy, and the general public. I have extensive experience working with HIV cohort studies in sub-Sahara Africa, and in the Netherlands. I collaborate with academic and public institutions as a researcher, lecturer, and  student supervisor (BSc, MSc and PhD level).

Since September 2018, I am a fellow of the European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training (EPIET) by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), for which I am based at the Robert Koch Institute in Berlin, Germany.
